I'll create a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that demonstrates various statistical methods and visualizations. Let me create this notebook in your Python workspace.

Using "Create New Jupyter Notebook"

Created statistical_analysis_demo.ipynb

Now I'll create the comprehensive statistical analysis notebook with various methods and visualizations:

Create the notebook title and introduction

Add section for importing required libraries


Add code cell for importing libraries

Add section for loading sample dataset

Add code cell for loading and exploring the dataset

Add section for descriptive statistics

Add code cell for descriptive statistics calculations

Add section for correlation analysis

Add code cell for correlation analysis

Add section for hypothesis testing

Add code cell for hypothesis testing

Add section for histogram visualizations

Add code cell for histogram visualizations

Add section for boxplot visualizations

Add code cell for boxplot visualizations

Add section for scatter plot visualizations

Add code cell for scatter plot visualizations

Add conclusion section

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that demonstrates a wide variety of statistical methods and visualizations. The notebook includes:

Statistical Methods Covered:
Descriptive Statistics - Mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis
Correlation Analysis - Pearson and Spearman correlations with significance testing
Hypothesis Testing - T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests
Visualization Techniques:
Histograms - Distribution analysis with mean/median lines
Boxplots & Violin Plots - Quartiles, outliers, and distribution shapes
Scatter Plots - Relationships between variables with regression lines
Heatmaps - Correlation matrices
Advanced plots - Bubble charts, density plots, and multi-category visualizations
Key Features:
Uses the popular Tips dataset from Seaborn for realistic examples
Includes statistical significance testing with p-values
Demonstrates both basic matplotlib and advanced seaborn plotting
Shows outlier detection methods
Provides interpretation of results
Contains comprehensive explanations for each method
The notebook is ready to run and will provide you with hands-on experience with statistical analysis and data visualization in Python. You can execute each cell sequentially to see the statistical methods in action and learn from the various visualization techniques demonstrated.
